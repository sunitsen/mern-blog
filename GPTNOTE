Things You Have Implemented in the Project:

    Created a Reusable Input Component
        Used type as a prop to handle different input types dynamically.

    Added Form Validation
        Frontend Validation: Ensured required fields are filled and formatted correctly.
        Backend Validation: Validated input data before processing requests.

    Implemented Dynamic Icon Change
        Changed icons dynamically based on input type (e.g., eye icon for password visibility).

    Applied CSS Styling
        Used CSS classes for form styling.
        Made the UI responsive across different devices.

    Added Page Animation
        Implemented smooth animations for form transitions.

    Created a Sign-Up & Sign-In Form
        Used the type prop to dynamically switch between Sign In and Sign Up.

    Implemented Routing Based on Type
        Used React Router to navigate between /signup and /signin routes.

    Handled Form Submission
        Used state management to capture and submit form data.

    Integrated API for Authentication
        Connected frontend with the backend for user authentication.

    Fixed Re-Rendering Issues

    Optimized the form to avoid unnecessary re-renders.


    Here are the new additions formatted in the same style:

Implemented User Profile Management

    Created a dynamic user profile page that displays user data fetched from the backend.
    Allowed users to edit their profile details, including changing their password and updating personal information.

Developed User Authentication Flow

    Integrated authentication states and user session management.
    Handled user sign-in, sign-up, and sign-out functionality with proper state transitions.

Implemented Protected Routes

    Used React Router to create protected routes that are accessible only to authenticated users.
    Redirected unauthenticated users to the login page when attempting to access protected routes.

Optimized State Management with Context API

    Managed user authentication data (e.g., user profile, access token) globally across components using React's Context API.
    Simplified prop drilling by utilizing global state for managing authentication and user details.

Enhanced UX with User Notifications

    Added a notification feature that displays new messages or alerts for the user.
    Implemented real-time updates for notifications.

Used Redux for Global State Management

    Incorporated Redux to manage global state for user authentication and session management.
    Streamlined the flow of data across multiple components.

Handled Form Validation with Custom Hooks

    Created a custom hook for handling form validation logic.
    Ensured that all form inputs are validated before submission, displaying error messages when needed.

Integrated Session Management with Local Storage

    Stored user session data in local storage to persist user login across page refreshes.
    Retrieved session data on app load to maintain the user's authentication state.

Implemented Dynamic Navigation Menu

    Dynamically rendered the navigation menu based on the user's authentication status.
    Created conditional routes and links that display user-related options (e.g., Profile, Dashboard) when logged in.

Improved Code Structure with Component Reusability

    Refactored components for reusability and maintainability.
    Created reusable button, input, and link components to streamline the UI code.

Added Password Strength Indicator

    Implemented a password strength indicator to help users create stronger passwords during sign-up or password change.
